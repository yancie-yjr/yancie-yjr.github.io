Hello! I am Jinrong Yang (杨金荣). I am currently a 4th year Ph.D student at the [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://www.hust.edu.cn), supervised by [Xiaoping Li](http://mse.hust.edu.cn/info/1143/1374.htm). I am also an intern at Megvii Technology, supervised by [Xiangyu Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yuB-cfoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Zheng Ge](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hJ-VrrIAAAAJ). Before that, I got my bachelor's degree at [China University of Mining and Technology (CUMT)](http://www.cumt.edu.cn/) in 2019 and was recommended to study for my doctor's degree at HUST.

My research interest mainly focus on **Multimodal learning (LLM, AIGC), 2/3D (Perception, Tracking, Prediction, and Planning)**.
